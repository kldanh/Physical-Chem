        "Often, we would like to do a task that doesn't have built-in support in Python.  For instance, basic Python cannot do something as simple as taking the sine of a number.  Fortunately, we can do these tasks by using *libraries*. The simplest way to think of libraries is as sets of tools that extend the capabilities of Python. The first library that you will meet is NumPy.\n",

        "## NumPy\n",
        " NumPy stands for Numerical Python.  This library has many mathematical funtions and has a useful tool called an array that we will discuss below.  When we use NumPy, we have to do two things:  \n",

        "All statements that use Numpy have to be prepended with np.  For instance, if we wanted to use the sine function the code below would not work:  \n",

        "We can also generate an array of evenly-spaced numbers using `np.arange`.  The command  `np.arange(start, stop, step)` to generate a one-dimensional array of numbers starting at the start value, increasing by the step value, and ending ***before*** the stop value.
